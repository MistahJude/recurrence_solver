# Recurrence Solver

## Overview

**Recurrence Solver** is a C program that computes the value of a specific recurrence relation using three methods: non-recursive (iterative), recursive, and closed-form solution.

## Recurrence Relation

\[ T(n) = 4 \cdot T(n-1) - 3 \cdot T(n-2) + 4 \]
with initial values:
\[ T(0) = 1 \]
\[ T(1) = 3 \]

Closed-form solution:
\[ T(n) = 2 \cdot 3^n - 2n - 1 \]

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**:
    ```sh
    gcc -o recurrence_solver recurrence_solver.c
    ```

2. **Run the Program**:
    ```sh
    ./recurrence_solver
    ```

3. **Input the Value for `n`**:
    - Example: `Input the value for N: 5`

4. **View the Results**:
    - Example output:
      ```
      The Non-Recursive Function: 485
      The Recursive Function: 485
      The Closed-Form Function: 485
      All methods produce the same result.
      ```
